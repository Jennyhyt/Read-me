I like read book at usual,but I also like to play with friends,such as LOL and tennis.

***About Github:***

I am the first time to use a web like this,have a little excited.

I want to write some what everyone can be read in my home page.

That's why I use english to write this text.

I do not have particularly big problem for the moment,except my shoddy english.

But I know,if things go on like this,it will have a huge change whether my english or my programming.
